ASSIGNMENT:

Design a Mini Cab Booking System (like Uber/Ola) using object-oriented principles.

The system should:

Calculate ride fare based on distance.

Support multiple pricing rules:

Normal pricing (₹10/km)

Surge pricing (₹25/km)

Support multiple payment methods:

UPI

Card

Wallet

Add logging and authentication to the book_ride() operation without modifying its internal code.

Maintain a single, shared application configuration containing:

App name

Currency symbol

Design Requirements:

Focus on clean design, extensibility, and low coupling.

You may use any OOP language and relevant design patterns.

Pricing strategy should be changeable at runtime.

Payment logic should not be hardcoded in the booking flow.
